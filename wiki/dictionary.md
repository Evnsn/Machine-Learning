**Distributed representation:**  
Distributed representation is a compact dense vector representing an object created a with neural networks. Distributed representation for symbolic data was introduced by Hinton (1985).

**Heterogeneous:**  
*Stacking* often considers heterogeneous weak learners, learns them in parallel, and combines them. In other words; it use different base learning algorithms to directly ensure ensemble diversity.

**Homogenous:**  
A data set is homogeneous if it is made up of things that are similar to each other.  
*Bagging* and *boosting* used homogenous weak learners for ensemble.

**Representation learning:**  
Representation learning aims to learn representations of rawdata as useful information for further classification or prediction. Some methds are; *K-mean clustering*, *PCA* and *ICA*.  
*Distributed representation* is also form of representation learning made with neural networks.
