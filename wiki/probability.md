# Probability


## Conditonal probability
$Pr(A)$ : Probability of A  
$Pr(A|B)$ : Probability of A given B

## Bayes Theorem
$Pr(A|B)=\frac{Pr(B|A)Pr(A)}{Pr(B)}$  

$A, B$ : events  
$Pr(A|B)$ : Probability of A given B is true.
$Pr(B|A)$ : Probability of B given A is true.   
$Pr(A), Pr(B)$ : The independent probabilities of A and B.


*In other word:*  
$posterior=\frac{likelihood*prior}{evidence}$  

**Posterior**: Conditional probability distribution representing what parameters are likely after observing the data object.  
**Prior**:  Probability distribution representing knowledge or uncertainty of a data object prior or before observing it.  
**Evidence**: We have observed that e.g. first name matches.  
**Likelihood/marginal**: The probability of falling under a specific category or class.
