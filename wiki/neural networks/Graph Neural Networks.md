# Graph Neural networks
A GNN Aims to cature the behavior of a system represented as a grap (Molekyles, Powergrids, Language). The graph maybe represented as a Adjecent matrix (2-2 matix), and changes over a set of time steps. The GNN tries to map these changes. Since its a sequential problem are recurrent networks usually used, but MLPs and CNNs could also be used.
