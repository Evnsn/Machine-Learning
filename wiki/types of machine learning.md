## Unsupervised lerning

## Reinforcment learning
Agent explore/exploit different state and polices.

## Self-supervised learning
...

## Active learning
Mostly the same as supervised learning, exept that people override label predictions when ML model results have high uncertainty (human in the loop).

## Weak supervision

# Transfer knowledge

## Transfere learning
Reuse a model previously trained on alot of data and resources. Fine-tune the model for new tasks.

## Knowledge graph
Graph representation of the context for features used to train models.

## Meta-learning
